## CanvasPro AI - Notes

### 1. Introduction and Project Setup

- `npx create-next-app@latest`
- install libraries
  - `shadcn/ui`
    - https://ui.shadcn.com/
- to run: `npm run dev`

### 2. Understanding the NextJS project structure

- https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure
- avoid middleware.ts if possible because it runs only on edge but we want to be able to deploy our app to any server
- Route Groups:
  - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups
- Private folders:
  - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation#private-folders

### 3. Fabric.js setup

- http://fabricjs.com/
- https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js
- http://fabricjs.com/docs/
- https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#compiling
- Create Editor page, component and useEditor.ts hook
- why we use canvasContainerRef
  - Canvas resizing is difficult hence we are using a div as canvasContainerRef and we will use a resize observer to see if canvasContainerRef is resized and use the width and height from there to set width and height of canvas
- `npm install fabric@5.3.0-browser --save` and `npm install -D @types/fabric@5.3.0`
  - the browser version is important because it is the only version that will not use node-canvas as dependency

### 4. Make responsive canvas using Resize Observer and add auto zoom
