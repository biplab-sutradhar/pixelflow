## CanvasPro AI - Notes

- Similar editor for inspiration:
  - https://github.com/ikuaitu/vue-fabric-editor built on vue

## Day 1

### 1. Introduction and Project Setup

- `npx create-next-app@latest`
- install libraries
  - `shadcn/ui`
    - https://ui.shadcn.com/
- to run: `npm run dev`

### 2. Understanding the NextJS project structure

- https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure
- avoid middleware.ts if possible because it runs only on edge but we want to be able to deploy our app to any server
- Route Groups:
  - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups
- Private folders:
  - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation#private-folders

### 3. Fabric.js setup

- http://fabricjs.com/
- https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js
- http://fabricjs.com/docs/
- https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#compiling
- Create Editor page, component and useEditor.ts hook
- why we use canvasContainerRef
  - Canvas resizing is difficult hence we are using a div as canvasContainerRef and we will use a resize observer to see if canvasContainerRef is resized and use the width and height from there to set width and height of canvas
- `npm install fabric@5.3.0-browser --save` and `npm install -D @types/fabric@5.3.0`
  - the browser version is important because it is the only version that will not use node-canvas as dependency

- Does not use file and folder structure like NextJS
  - hence more scalable than NextJS
  - It's fast
  - It integrates well with NextJS
  - Runs on several runtime environments
  - we will learn more about RPC routes

## Day 6

### 31. Exploring Hono more in detail and building Photos support with react query, unsplash API

- https://hono.dev/docs/api/routing
- https://hono.dev/docs/guides/best-practices
- https://hono.dev/docs/guides/best-practices#building-a-larger-application
- https://hono.dev/docs/guides/validation
  - hono has thin minimial validation. so use a third party library for validation like zod
- https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc
  - don't forget to chain your rpc routes
    - https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc#using-rpc-with-larger-applications
  - also declare them in a separate variable as `const route =...`
- https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc#client
- React Query setup with Nextjs
  - https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/advanced-ssr#server-components-and-nextjs-app-router

## Day 8

### 44. Auth setup with Auth.js

- Note: NextAuth v4 is now called as Auth.js which is v5 so make sure you are on the correct website
- https://authjs.dev/ ✅ v5 - we will be using this
- https://next-auth.js.org/ ❌ v4

- 1. Setup:

  - Installation: https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=Next.js
  - Do the setup and test by visiting the url: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/providers to see if providers is empty and working fine

- 2. Authentication:

  - OAuth with Github
  - Test: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/providers and http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin and http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signout

- 🚨 TODO: Vercel Image optimization free tire exhausted

### 45. Postgresql DB with neon connector and Drizzle Setup with Auth.js

- https://neon.tech/
- Drizzle orm setup
  - https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/connect-neon
- https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/drizzle
- https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/drizzle#schemas

### 46. Build Auth Pages UI and add Google OAuth

- build login, logout(temporary) and register pages
- google oauth:
  - https://console.cloud.google.com/
  - create a project -> apis and services -> oauth consent screen -> Choose External --> Click Create -> Save
  - Credentials --> OAuth Client ID --> Web Application --> Name: CanvasPro --> Authorized redirect URIs: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google

### 47. Credentials Auth with Auth.js

- https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/credentials
- For google and github we have used db session strategy but for credentials we will use jwt strategy
- db session strategy will create sessions with user id while jwt strategy sessions will not have an id. In order to add id follow this: https://authjs.dev/guides/extending-the-session
- make sure to add password to the user schema so that it is saved in db.
- `npm run db:generate`
- `npm run db:migrate`
- `npm run db:studio`

- Note: Better to avoid credentials provider and stick to OAuth providers, magic link etc. And if that's the case, then we can use the db session strategy for all providers and get rid of jwt strategy

## Day 9

### 48. Adding auth for hono API

- create a test.ts route to make it protected route
- https://hono.dev/docs/middleware/third-party

### 55. Mark design as template, Create templates page

### 56. SAAS Implementation - UI with Zustand

- Important: zustand is a client side state management library and if the component controlled by zustand are rendered on server side then it will cause some hydration issues. So make sure to use zustand only on client side. Also note that "use client" will not make sure that the component is not rendered on server side

### 57. SAAS Implementation - BE with Stripe

- Stripe - create account --> create business ---> Get api key ---> Create product ---> ex: monthly subscription with recurring billing --> after creating product get into pricing section and find pricing id.
